In a dictionary, the elements are accessed using their keys, not their positions. Keys can be of any immutable type, such as strings or numbers, while values can be of any type, including lists or other dictionaries. Dictionaries are useful when you want to store data in a way that can be easily looked up by a key.\n",

Lists are useful when you want to store an ordered sequence of elements, and you need to access them in a specific order. Unlike dictionaries, lists can contain duplicate elements, and their elements can be of any type."
