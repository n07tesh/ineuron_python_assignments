        "  PyInputPlus is commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pypi to make it easier to reference PyInputPlus functions and classes within the code. The as pypi part of the import statement creates an alias or nickname for the pyinputplus module, allowing the programmer to refer to it with a shorter name. This can make the code shorter and more readable, especially when using PyInputPlus functions and classes frequently throughout the code.\n"

On the other hand, the inputFloat() function is used to accept input from the user, and it ensures that the input is a float.
