They are usually represented by a backslash character () followed by a specific letter or combination of characters.\n",
        "and we use them,the newline character, which is used to insert a line break in a text, can be represented by the escape sequence \"\\n\". Similarly, the tab character can be represented by \"\\t\", the backslash character itself by \"\\\" and the double quote character by \"\"\".\n",
